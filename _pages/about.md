ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Ilgiz Khabibullin, but everybody calls me Habib :) Cybersecurity Analyst with a Passion for SOC Environments, Threat Detection, and Military Discipline.

Welcome to my world of cybersecurity! Iâ€™m someone who thrives on learning and innovation, especially in protecting digital ecosystems from the ever-growing landscape of cyber threats. My journey in this field has been driven by curiosity, dedication, and a desire to continually evolve alongside the industry.

A Lifelong Commitment to Cybersecurity
From my early days of learning the basics of network security to working hands-on in SOC environments, Iâ€™ve immersed myself in the tools and technologies that help defend against modern threats. Each day presents a new challenge, and thatâ€™s what excites meâ€”staying ahead of attackers by refining my skills in threat detection, incident response, and digital defense strategies.

My background in the military, where I served as a Transportation Specialist (MOS 88M) in the Army National Guard, has equipped me with a strong sense of discipline, teamwork, and the ability to stay calm under pressure. These traits are invaluable when responding to cybersecurity incidents and protecting critical infrastructure.

My Key Areas of Expertise:
SIEM Mastery: Splunk, IBM QRadar, and SentinelOne
Endpoint Security: CrowdStrike, SentinelOne
Firewall Management: Fortinet NextGen Firewalls
Vulnerability Management: Nessus, Tenable.io
Incident Response: Acunetix, TheHive
Threat Intelligence & OSINT: Proofpoint, Wireshark, and more!
Hands-on Experience & Continuous Learning
Currently, Iâ€™m involved in a 30-Day MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, where Iâ€™m sharpening my skills by setting up environments, managing Elastic Agent and Fleet Server, and configuring Windows Server environments. Every new task brings practical, real-world experience that Iâ€™m excited to bring to the table in any SOC environment.

Some recent milestones Iâ€™m proud of include:

Setting up Elastic Agent on my Windows Server and successfully enrolling it into Fleet.
Configuring Fleet Server to manage and monitor endpoints effectively.
Installing and managing Windows Server 2022, critical for SOC environments.
Why I Love Cybersecurity
In a world where data is more valuable than ever, securing it is not just a jobâ€”itâ€™s my passion. Every incident I investigate, every attack I help mitigate, brings a sense of fulfillment that drives me forward. Whether it's detecting a phishing attempt or stopping a brute force attack, I find meaning in every challenge.

Cybersecurity isnâ€™t just what I doâ€”itâ€™s who I am. My mission is to contribute to a safer digital future, and Iâ€™m eager to bring that commitment and my expertise to your organization.
